			<h3>Version control</h3>
			<p>
			  You're probably here because you created a SourceKettle project for keeping track of tasks and time, and you didn't need
			  a version control repository at the time - but now you do!
			</p>
			<p>
			  That's no problem, you can add one now. Note that you will not be able to remove the repo or change the repository type later
			  without bugging your system administrator to do it for you (and buying them cake).
