			<h3>Viewing source code</h3>
			<p>To start viewing the source code that is attached to your project, select '<a href="#"><i class="icon-pencil"></i> Source</a>' from the projects sidebar. It's as simple as that! From here you can traverse the folder hierarchy of your repository.</p>
		</div>

			<h3>Getting the code flowing</h3>
			<p>
			If you want to use source control, you will first need to set up at least one <a href='/help/addkey'>SSH key</a>.
			</p>
			<h4>Already a git wizard?</h4>
			<p>
			If you already know what you're doing and just want a git URL, it will look like:
			<pre><?= $sourcekettle_config['SourceRepository']['user']['value'] ?>@<?= $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] ?>:projects/my-project-name.git</pre>
			</p>
			<p>
			If you have created a brand, spanking new project but haven't yet checked anything in, click on the '<a href='#'><i class="icon-pencil"></i>Source</a>' link in your project's sidebar for instructions on how to get started (it'll tell you all the project-specific stuff so you can pretty much copy-and-paste lines into a terminal).
			</p>

		</div>
		<div class="well">
			<h3>Checking out an existing repository</h3>
			<p>
			If you've got an existing project full of code-y goodness, at some point you will probably want to check out a copy somewhere else! You will need to run:
			<pre>git checkout <?= $sourcekettle_config['SourceRepository']['user']['value'] ?>@<?= $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] ?>:projects/my-project-name.git</pre>

			...with your actual project name, of course! The URI for your actual repository is displayed on the source page for easy copy-and-pasting.
