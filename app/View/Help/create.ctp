			<h3>Creating projects</h3>

			<p>To create a new project, click on the projects link in the navigation bar. Once you are on the projects home page, click on the blue "New Project" button. A form will appear allowing you to create a new project.</p>

			<h4>Step 1) Project name</h4>

			<p>You will need to enter a short name for the project. The name will be both the name of the project and of the repository (if you decide to create one). It must be: a valid UNIX name - that means it must start with a letter and only contain letters, numbers, dashes and underscores. The project name <strong>must be unique</strong>.</p>

			<h5>Examples</h5>

			<div class="row-fluid">
				<div class="span6">
					<div class="alert alert-success">
						<strong>Valid:</strong> devtrack_task_tracker
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="span6">
					<div class="alert alert-error">
						<strong>Invalid:</strong> phill&chris'_(project)
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>

			<h4>Step 2) Project description</h4>

			<p>You can then enter a description of the project. This is useful for giving more detail about the project. It is an <i>optional</i> field and as such does not need to be provided, but it is useful for others who would like to know what your project does.</p>

			<h5>Examples</h5>

			<div class="row-fluid">
				<div class="span6">
					<div class="alert alert-success">
						<strong>Good:</strong> SourceKettle is a project management tool which is designed to be easy to deploy, manage and use. Features include: Git repository server, task tracking, attachments and time management.
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="span6">
					<div class="alert alert-error">
						<strong>Bad:</strong> SourceKettle is the best project management tool you'll ever use! There's no need to explain what it does, it is just the most amazing thing since hot water! Use it! NOW! I saw a swan yesterday.
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>

			<h4>Step 3) Public projects</h4>

			<p>SourceKettle allows you to have public and private projects. By default, all your projects are private. If you wish to make a project public, then check the box "Public". The project will only be visible to registered users.</p>

			<h4>Step 4) Repository type</h4>

			<p>SourceKettle allows you to create a repository to store your code. Regardless of which option you choose, SourceKettle will allow you to view your files in your web browser and compare changes between versions of a file.</p>

			<h4>And finally...</h4>

			<p>Click the button that says "Create Project"</p>
			<div class="alert alert-info">
