			<h3>Listing projects</h3>

			<p>Here at DevTrack, we have tried to pack as much information into the project views as possible. This can however, be daunting to new users who do not know what all the little icons mean, so here is a breakdown:</p>

			<h4>1) Public vs. Private</h4>

			<p>See that little <i class="icon-lock"></i> at the top right of <strong>exhibit 1</strong>? That means that the project is private and you should keep its existence super secret! If you see a <i class="icon-globe"></i> (<strong>exhibit 2</strong>) then this means the project is public and can be viewed by any DevTrack member.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="row-fluid">
			<div class="offset1 span5">
				<div class="well project-well">
					<h3 class="project-title">
						<a href="#" class="project-link">SuperSect3t</a>
						<span style="float: right;"><i class="icon-lock"></i></span>
					</h3>
					<p class="project-desc">A very secret project that you shouldn't tell anyone about.</p>
					<p class="project-time">Last Modified: 8 hours, 2 minutes ago</p>
				</div>
				<div class="alert alert-info">
					<strong>Exhibit 1:</strong> A private project
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="span5">
				<div class="well project-well">
					<h3 class="project-title">
						<a href="#" class="project-link">Publ1cProj</a>
						<span style="float: right;"><i class="icon-globe"></i></span>
					</h3>
					<p class="project-desc">A public project that will make life better for everyone who gazes upon it.</p>
					<p class="project-time">Last Modified: 4 hours, 20 minutes ago</p>
				</div>
				<div class="alert alert-info">
					<strong>Exhibit 2:</strong> A public project
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="well">
			<h4>2) Title, description and last modified</h4>

			<p>These parts of the view are mostly self explanatory but can, occasionally, be confusing. At the top we have the title of the project (<strong>SuperSect3t</strong> in <strong>exhibit 1</strong>). Following this we have the projects description and finally we have the last time that the project was modified.</p>
			<div class="alert alert-info">
