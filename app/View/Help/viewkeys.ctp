          <h3> Changing SSH keys</h3>
          <p>
            Given that SSH keys are just a line of text, there's not much point in being able to edit them individually - so, we only allow delete functionality.
          </p>

          <p>
            On the "Edit Keys" page, you will see a list of your SSH keys, with an option to delete each one.  If something Bad has happened, such as somebody stealing your private key, or you forgot the passphrase, or you deleted the private key and didn't have a backup, this page lets you erase all trace of the key.
          </p>

          <p>
            As when adding keys, this will take a little time to take effect as the keys are synced periodically (usually every minute or two).
