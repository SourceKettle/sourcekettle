          <p>
            Sometimes it may be helpful to add a file to the project, such as a design document of help video.  If the system administrator has enabled this feature, you can click the '<a href="#"><i class="icon-file"></i>Attachments</a>' link in the project sidebar to get started.
          </p>

          <p>
            To upload a file, click the aptly-named <button class="btn btn-mini btn-primary">Upload file</button> button at the top right.  Simply select a file from your computer and click upload; however, it must be under the file size limit and must be of a known type.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once you have uploaded one or more files, they will appear in a list, easily filtered by file type.  You can click on the file to download it, or click on the delete button (<a href="#" class="btn btn-danger btn-mini"><i class="icon-eject icon-white"></i></a>) to remove it from the project.
