          <h3>Deleting your account</h3>

          <p>
            It's not very likely, but at some point you may wish to completely delete your account.  You will be asked for confirmation first.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Very Important Notice:</strong> be very, <em>very</em> sure before clicking 'yes'! It will also delete any projects for which you are the only contributor, and this is <strong>not reversible!</strong></p>

          <p>
            Note that this option is only available for "internal" accounts - for more information about "internal" and "external" accounts, see the <?= $this->Html->link('account details help page', array('controller' => 'help', 'action' => 'details'))?>.
