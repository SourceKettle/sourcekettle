Dear <?= $User['User']['name'] ?>,

A request to reset your password was made, if this was by you then please click the link below within the next 30 minutes.

<?= $this->Html->url('/users/reset_password/'.$Key['LostPasswordKey']['key'], true) ?>

This definitely wasn't you?
Then please ignore this email and the key will expire shortly.

Not again?!
If this keeps happening then please reply to this email accordingly.

Regards,
