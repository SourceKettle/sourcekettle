Dear <?= $User['User']['name'] ?>,

A request to reset your password was made, if this was by you then please click the link below within the next 30 minutes.

<?= $this->Html->url('/users/reset_password/'.$Key['LostPasswordKey']['key'], true) ?>

This definately wasn't you?
Then please ignore this email and the key will expire shortly.

Not again?!
If this keeps happening then please reply to this email accordingly.

Regards,
  The Devtrack Team
