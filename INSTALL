Quick install instructions
==========================

Prerequisites
-------------

* Apache
* mod_rewrite
* mod_php (PHP >= 5.2.8)
* MySQL (>= 5.1)

Get everything in place
-----------------------

* Make sure you've got all submodules:
  git submodule update --init --recursive

Webserver setup
---------------

* Make sure your apache virtualhost config allows the use of .htaccess files
* Point apache at the devtrack directory (the parent directory of 'app')

DevTrack setup
--------------

* Run scm-scripts/devtrack-setup.py
* Ensure permissions are correct (TODO put this in the setup script):
  chown -R apache:devtrack tmp/ Plugin/TwitterBootswatch/webroot/ # set user and group as appropriate
* Set 'Security.cipherSeed' and 'Security.salt' in Config/core.php
* Reload/restart apache
* Load the webpage, then go to /setup to see any possible problems

Multiple VirtualHosts
---------------------

If you want to set up several DevTrack installations in different vhosts, this is supported - simply
run through the setup steps above for each installation.  You should of course set a different user,
group, Security.salt, Security.cipherSeed and repository directory for each install.

You will also need to change the following settings in app/Config/core.php:

* $prefix - MUST be different for each installation, or Weird Caching Things will happen and you will be sad
* Session => cookie - this doesn't necessarily need to be different, but will make it more obvious when debugging problems!


LDAP authentication
-------------------

To use this, currently it's a case of "add some lines to the AppController" :-(

Edit app/Controller/AppController.php and add something like this to the authenticate array (before Form):

	'LDAPAuthCake.LDAP' => array(
		// Connection details, the user account only needs read access
	    'ldap_url'      => 'ldaps://ldap.example.org',
    	'ldap_bind_dn'  => 'cn=LdapReadOnlyUser,ou=User,dc=example,dc=org',
	    'ldap_bind_pw'  => 'CorrectHorseBatteryStaple',

		// Base DN to search under
    	'ldap_base_dn'  => 'ou=User,dc=example,dc=org',

		// %USERNAME% will be replaced with the email address - this should be a valid LDAP
		// filter that will find a user account based on the email address.
		// Finding by proxyAddresses should allow them to use ANY email address they have.
    	'ldap_filter'   => '(| (proxyAddresses=SMTP:%USERNAME%) (proxyAddresses=smtp:%USERNAME%) )',

		// These are DevTrack-specific, leave alone
    	'form_fields'   => array ('username' => 'email', 'password' => 'password'),

		// Mapping of LDAP attributes to DevTrack database fields
		// Should just need name and email fields.
	    'ldap_to_user'  => array(
    	    'displayName' => 'name',
	        'mail'        => 'email',
    	),

		// Default flags to set when creating the DevTrack account entry on first login.
		// This is pretty sane...
	    'defaults'      => array(
    		'is_active'   => 1,
	        'is_admin'    => 0,
		),
	),
