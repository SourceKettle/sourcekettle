Quick install instructions
==========================

Unfortunately, SourceKettle is not currently available as a package for easy installation. Sorry about that :-(

Prerequisites
-------------

You will need to install the following packages before you start:

* Apache
* mod_rewrite
* mod_php (PHP >= 5.2.8)
* MySQL (>= 5.1)
* mod_ssl, if you wish to use a secure connection (definitely do this for a production setup!)

What to know in advance
-----------------------

You will need to know:

* Basic knowledge of how to configure Apache on your distro
* Your MySQL root password

Getting the code
----------------

* Choose where you want to install SourceKettle (here we're putting it in /var/www/sourcekettle, adjust to taste)
* Get a copy of the code
  cd /var/www/
  git clone https://github.com/SourceKettle/sourcekettle.git
  cd sourcekettle

* If you want to use the development version (newer, more features, but may not be 100% working!), switch to the develop branch:
  git checkout develop

* Make sure you've got all submodules checked out:
  git submodule update --init --recursive

Webserver setup
---------------

* Point apache at the sourcekettle directory (/var/www/sourcekettle in our example; you may want to use a separate VirtualHost for this)
* Make sure your apache config allows the use of .htaccess files
* Optional, but recommended: set up SSL

Please refer to the apache documentation for more information on configuring apache. This should be less of a problem once we release packages for SourceKettle!

SourceKettle setup script
-------------------------

* Run the setup script and follow the instructions (run it with the --help option to see possible arguments)
  ./scm-scripts/sourcekettle-setup.py
* Reload/restart apache
* Load the webpage, then go to /setup to see any possible problems

Add an admin user
-----------------

At the moment, the setup script doesn't do this for you :-( Sorry.

Add yourself an admin user so you can log in, e.g.:

cd app
./Console/cake user add root@localhost.local "System Administrator" -a -p adminPassword


Get started
-----------

You should now be able to log into SourceKettle using your admin account (in this example, use the email address root@localhost.local and the password adminPassword).



Multiple VirtualHosts
---------------------

If you want to set up several SourceKettle installations in different vhosts, this is supported - simply
run through the setup steps above for each installation.  You should of course set a different user,
group, Security.salt, Security.cipherSeed and repository directory for each install.

You will also need to change the following settings in app/Config/core.php:

* $prefix - MUST be different for each installation, or Weird Caching Things will happen and you will be sad
* Session => cookie - this doesn't necessarily need to be different, but will make it more obvious when debugging problems!
