Devtrack is designed to be a multi-user project management and source code management tool.

The aims are to make it as simple as possible to use, install and extend.

It's currently in the early development stages.



Quick and dirty setup guide, assumes reasonable knowledge:

* Make sure you've got all submodules:
  git submodule init
  git submodule update
  cd app/Plugin/GitCake/
  git submodule init
  git submodule update
  cd app/Plugin/SVNCake/
  git submodule init
  git submodule update
* Install apache with mod_rewrite, mysql and php5
* Get apache/mysql/php running, create database(s)
* Make sure your apache virtualhost config allows the use of .htaccess files
* Point apache at the devtrack directory (the parent directory of 'app')
* cp app/Config/database.php.default app/Config/database.php
* Edit app/Config/database.php and set database details
* cat db.sql | mysql <dbname> -u <user> --password=<password>
* Run scm-scripts/git-setup.sh
* Reload/restart apache
* Load the webpage, then go to /setup to see any possible problems
